Responsible AI at Forcent.ai

Last updated: [Insert Date]

At Forcent.ai, we believe AI should make businesses more efficient without replacing human judgment, harming trust, or creating risk.
This page explains our approach to building and deploying AI responsibly.

Our commitment is simple:
AI should help people, not replace them.

1. Human in the Loop (Always)

AI speeds up work, but people remain in control.

We design all systems so that:

AI assists with tasks, but humans make final decisions

Important actions (like approvals, sensitive responses, or major changes) always involve a person

Businesses can override, correct, or adjust AI outputs at any time

AI should support your team — not make decisions for them.

2. Transparency

We communicate clearly about:

What our AI does

What it does not do

What data it uses

How its recommendations are generated

We avoid “black box” solutions.
You always know when and how AI is used in your workflow.

3. Data Privacy & Security

We follow strict privacy and security practices:

We do not sell your data

We only use the information needed to provide our services

Sensitive information is protected with secure storage and encrypted communication

You control what data you want to share or remove

Your data belongs to you, not us.

4. Fairness & Bias Reduction

We take steps to reduce unfair or biased outcomes by:

Avoiding the use of personal or sensitive demographic data

Testing AI outputs for consistency and fairness

Allowing humans to review or correct AI recommendations

Our goal is to ensure AI behaves consistently and responsibly for all users.

5. Accuracy & Reliability

AI is powerful, but not perfect.
We design Forcent.ai systems with:

Regular monitoring

Quality checks

Human oversight

Continuous improvement

We openly acknowledge limitations and work to keep improving accuracy.

6. No Full Automation of Critical Tasks

AI should enhance, not replace, important business functions such as:

Legal decisions

Medical diagnoses

Financial approvals

Safety-critical operations

Forcent.ai solutions never automate these without human involvement.

7. Customer Control

You remain in full control of:

When AI is used

What tasks AI performs

What data it can access

When you want to turn it off

We believe responsible AI means giving businesses power, not taking it away.

8. Continuous Improvement

Responsible AI is not a one-time checklist.
We regularly update our practices to:

Adapt to new regulations

Improve safety

Enhance transparency

Reduce bias

Maintain the highest ethical standards

We stay aligned with industry guidelines and best practices.

9. Honest Limitations

AI can:

Automate repetitive tasks

Speed up operations

Improve consistency

Provide recommendations

But AI cannot:

Fully replace human judgment

Guarantee perfect accuracy

Understand human context the way people can

We commit to being honest about what our AI can and cannot do.
